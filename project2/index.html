<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing">
<P><strong>Alcohol</strong> has been brewed domestically throughout its 7,000-year history, beginning in the Neolithic period in Mesopotamia(modern Iraq), Egypt, and China. It seems to have first developed as thick beers and meads, although fruit and rice wineswere also developed. Greece and Rome privileged the cultivation of grape wine and, to a lesser extent, beer. Domestic production in larger households was directed by wives but often carried out by slaves. Meanwhile, in the far east, by the Han dynasty, China had abandoned both in favor of the much stronger huangjiu and rice wines, both of which were traditionally warmed prior to consumption. By the Tang dynasty, homebrewing seems to have been a familiar domestic chore in China, albeit the lower classes had to make do with poorly-filtered mash. However, laws against making alcohol were enacted and repealed 41 times between the Zhou and Ming dynasties.</p>
<p>
Mass production of brewed beverages began in the 18th century with the Industrial Revolution. Innovations, like thermometers and hydrometers, allowed increases in efficiency. French microbiologist Louis Pasteur explained the role of yeast in beer fermentation in 1857, allowing brewers to develop strains of yeast with desirable properties (conversion efficiency, ability to handle higher alcohol content).</p></blockquote>
